TamTam RLottie integration
--------------------------
This project now supports real RLottie rendering via TamTam's @tamtam-chat/lottie-player
(see README on GitHub). We dynamically import their ESM bundle from GitHub Pages and point
the worker to their hosted worker.js, so you don't have to bundle WASM yourself.

How to force rlottie:
- Open the app with ?engine=rlottie, or run in DevTools:
    localStorage.setItem('lp_engine', 'rlottie'); location.reload();

If you want to self-host:
- Copy TamTam's built files and set TT_MODULE_URL and TT_WORKER_URL in src/app/rlottieTT.js
  to your own origin (same-origin is recommended for Workers).
